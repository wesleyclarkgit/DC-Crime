# DC-Crime
An analysis of registered crimes in Washington DC over a 10 year span


Washington DC has a long history of struggling to deal with inner-city crime.  In 1997, the NBA DC basketball team even changed its name from the Washington Bullets to the Wizards.  For this project an in depth analysis of crime was conducted in Washington DC.  The purpose of this research is to better understand what contributes specifically to violent crime.  While non-violent crime is of course important to understand, everyone can agree that violent crime has no place in our society.  I built several predictive models to differentiate violent and non-violent crime, in order to comprehend what variables contribute to violent crime in Washington DC.
